## **Step 1: Getting Started**

**Introduction**  
Begin your journey by exploring a harmful asteroid, a potential threat tracked by NASA.  
Learn why asteroid monitoring is essential for planetary defense.

---

## **Step 2: Explore the Map**

Open the Live Asteroid Map and track orbital paths.  
Understand how small changes in trajectory can make the difference between a safe flyby and a catastrophic impact.

---

## **Step 3: Run a Simulation**

Use the Impact Simulator to input asteroid parameters.  
Select Earthâ€™s impact point and watch crater sizes, blast zones, and seismic/tsunami effects unfold in real time.

---

## **Step 4: Test Defenses**

Try the Defense Simulator:

- Deploy a kinetic impactor.
- Experiment with a gravity tractor.
- Test nuclear disruption as an extreme measure for large or late-detected asteroids.
- If all fails, AstraNex auto-generates evacuation zones with population data.

---

## **Step 5: Explore Statistics**

In our Statistics feature, the historical impact data forms a crucial knowledge base for understanding planetary threats and improving future defense strategies.

---

## **Step 6: Learn & Share**

- Use the AI Buddy to get simple explanations.
- Export your simulation as a PDF report for planning or classroom use.

---

## **Educational Goals**

1. Build public awareness of asteroid threats through engaging visuals.
2. Empower decision-makers with data-driven simulations.
3. Provide students with a fun, educational way to explore orbital mechanics, geology, and disaster management.
4. Inspire future planetary defenders by combining science, technology, and storytelling.
